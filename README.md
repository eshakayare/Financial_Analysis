Bitcoin Data Analysis
This project investigates Bitcoin’s market dynamics over the period 2009–2024 using Python-based quantitative modeling, including ARIMA time series forecasting, RSI (Relative Strength Index) analysis, and Sharpe ratio evaluation. The goal is to extract predictive insights and risk-adjusted performance metrics to guide portfolio management decisions under conditions of elevated volatility. Recommended strategies include cross-asset diversification, alignment with cyclical momentum phases, and deployment of systematic risk controls to address Bitcoin’s inherently speculative and skewed return distribution.

The Python implementation leverages libraries such as statsmodels, pandas and NumPy to model temporal dependencies, detect momentum signals, and compute volatility-adjusted returns. Results indicate the presence of non-stationary behavior, regime shifts, and exogenous shock responses aligned with macroeconomic and regulatory developments. Sharpe ratio trends reveal elevated return dispersion, requiring dynamic rebalancing and drawdown management.
Correlation and cointegration tests with traditional asset classes (e.g., equities, gold, fiat currencies) further validate Bitcoin’s role as a partially non-correlated digital asset. The study highlights the necessity of algorithmic investment frameworks, real-time data ingestion, and continuous model validation for effective strategy execution in crypto markets.
