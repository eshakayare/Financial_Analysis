Bitcoin Market Analysis (2009‚Äì2024)

A Quantitative Study Using Python

Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Bitcoin's market behavior from 2009 to 2024. The project leverages Python and statistical modeling to assess trends, volatility, and risk-adjusted returns. The study offers actionable insights for businesses and investors navigating the high-risk, high-reward landscape of cryptocurrencies.

üß† Objectives
* Analyze long-term Bitcoin price trends and cyclical behavior

* Model volatility and market dynamics using ARIMA

* Identify momentum signals through RSI

* Evaluate investment performance using Sharpe Ratio

* Correlate key blockchain metrics with market performance

* Provide strategic business recommendations based on findings

üîç Methodology
* Time Series Modeling: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

* Momentum Analysis: Relative Strength Index (RSI)

* Performance Evaluation: Sharpe Ratio

* Correlation Studies: Miner revenue, transaction fees, block size, hash rate, and more

Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, ta, seaborn
üìà Key Insights
* Bitcoin exhibits high volatility with clear cyclical patterns

* Strong correlation exists between miner revenue and transaction costs (r = 0.92)

* ARIMA(0,1,0) performed better than complex models in predicting price behavior

* RSI flagged speculative bubbles (2017, 2021) and market corrections

* Sharpe Ratio of 0.365 reflects suboptimal risk-adjusted returns

üß© Business Implications
* Treat Bitcoin as a speculative asset with significant risk exposure

* Diversify portfolios and hedge against market downturns

* Align strategies with momentum cycles and technical indicators

* Monitor blockchain fundamentals (hash rate, block size, fees) for operational decisions
